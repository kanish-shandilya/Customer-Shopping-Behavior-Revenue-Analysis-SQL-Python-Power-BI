End-to-end Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis using SQL, Python, and Power BI to evaluate demographic trends, subscription performance, and revenue contribution across customer segments, with business-focused insights and executive reporting.

📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of customer shopping behavior using transactional sales data. The objective was to understand how demographic attributes (age group, gender), customer type, and subscription categories influence revenue generation and purchasing patterns.

The project follows a complete analytics workflow — from raw data processing to dashboard visualization and executive-level reporting.

🎯 Business Problem

Businesses often struggle to identify:

Which customer segments contribute the most revenue

Whether subscription customers generate higher value

How demographic groups influence sales performance

Which segments should be targeted for growth strategies

This project aims to provide data-driven insights to support strategic decisions in customer targeting, subscription optimization, and revenue enhancement.

🛠 Tech Stack

SQL – Data querying, aggregation, segmentation

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data cleaning & exploratory analysis

Power BI – Interactive dashboard & KPI visualization
